      XSHUT (shutdown) pin. This pin can be used to shutdown
      the sensor or perform hardware reset.

      This pin is active low, meaning:
      - Low = sensor shutdown
      - High = sensor active

    description: |
      GPIO1 interrupt pin. This pin is used for detection threshold
      interrupts and data ready signaling.

      This pin is active low, meaning:
      - Low = interrupt/data ready condition
      - High = no interrupt
